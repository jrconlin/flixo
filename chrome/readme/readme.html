<h1>Using Flixo</h1>

<p>Flixo does a few things to make your life a bit easier.</p>

<ol>
<li>It automatically OAuth signs requests</li>
<li>It queries for replacement tokens in strings.</li>
<li>It provides Expand categories and views for results</li>
<ol>

<p>Flixo is very much a work in progress and <a href="mailto:jconlin@netflix.com">I'd
love to hear your complaints and ideas.</a></p>

<h2>Installing</h2>
<p> To install Flixo, simply grab the flixo.xpi file and drop it onto Firefox.</p>

<h2>The Flixo Bar</h2>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>This is where you create profiles for Flixo to use. It's important to create
at least one profile before using Flixo. To do so, click "Create New Profile" in
the Active User Profiles section.<p>
<h4>Profiles</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Profile Name:</dt>
<dd>This can be anything and allows you to remember what this profile is. </dd>
<dt>Consumer Key:</dt>
<dd>This is the value provided to you after registration.</dd>
<dt>Shared Secret:</dt>
<dd>This value is also provided to you after registration.</dd>
<dt>User ID</dt>
<dd>This value is the encoded User ID for your user. This is normally provided as part of the
access token.</dd>
<dt>The following items will eventually be auto fetched, however for now please enter them in by hand.</dt>
<dt>User Token</dt>
<dd>The OAuth User Token value. Normally provided as part of the access token</dd>
<dt>User Secret</dt>
<dd>The OAuth User Secret value. Normally provided as part of the access token and should not be
shared publically.</dd>
<dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd>The pre-registered application name for this Token/Secret</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once you make any changes or additions, remember to click the [Add/Update Profile] button to
save your work.</p>
<h4>Host Patterns</h4>
<p>This is a comma separated list of the root hosts where Flixo should sign requests. These are matched
using a regular expression, so be careful how you enter the host. (e.g. 'netflix.com' would match against
any *.netflix.com host.)</p>
<p>As with the Profiles section, Click "Set" to save your changes.</p>
<h3>Accounts</h3>
<p>This is a list of the created Profiles. You can select the profile you wish
to make active by clicking on it. The Active profile is marked with a radio button
dot next to the name.</p>
<h3>Send Auth Info</h3>
<p>This allows you to determine what level of Auth information to send out.</p>
<h3>Expand</h3>
<p>For catalog queries that have "expandable" elements, provide the list of items to automatically expand.</p>
<h3>View</h3>
<p>Return the results as Plain ol' XML, JSON, Atom XML format or Atom</p>
<h3>Jump To</h3>
<p>Just a handy set of links to jump to. Top of API list, the User branch or the Catalog branch.</p>
<h2>Flixotize</h2>
<p>If you select a link, and right click (or bring up the context menu), you'll see an option to "flixotize"
the link. (make sure you select the entire link.)</p>
<p>Flixo-ing a link will ask to substitute variables in the template (if any
exist) and load it to the current window. This will autosign the URL for you.</p>
