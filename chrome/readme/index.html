<h1>Using Flixo</h1>

<p>Flixo does a few things to make your life a bit easier.</p>

<ol>
<li>It automatically OAuth signs requests to NetFlix hosts.</li>
<li>It queries for replacement tokens in strings.</li>
<li>It provides Expand categories and views for results</li>
</ol>

<p>Flixo is very much a work in progress and <a href="mailto:jconlin@netflix.com">I'd
love to hear your complaints and ideas.</a></p>

<h2>Installing</h2>
<p> To install Flixo, simply grab the flixo.xpi file and drop it onto Firefox. This product is still in
development, and unfortunately, updates cannot be automatically provided. Please check the Flixo website
for updates at this time.</p>

<h2>The Flixo Bar</h2>
<img src="flixo_bar.png" alt="The Flixo toolbar"/>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>This is where you create profiles for Flixo to use. It's important to create
at least one profile before using Flixo. To do so, click "<i>Create New Profile</i>" in
the Active User Profiles section.<p>
<img src="flixo_options.png" alt="The Flixo options panel" title="I've grayed out my values" />
<h4>Profiles</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Profile Name:</dt>
<dd>This can be anything and allows you to remember what this profile is. </dd>
<dt>API Key:</dt>
<dd>This is the value provided to you after registration.</dd>
<dt>Shared Secret:</dt>
<dd>This value is also provided to you after registration.</dd>
<dt><span class="button">Fetch OAuth Info</span> button</dt>
<dd>This button will attempt to fetch the remaining information based on your API key and secret.
It may display a Netflix Login window to accept your netflix login and account, or it may simply
display a confirmation window if you're already logged into Netflix.</dd>
<dt>Access Token</dt>
<dd>The OAuth User Token value. Normally provided as part of the access token</dd>
<dt>Token Secret</dt>
<dd>The OAuth User Secret value. Normally provided as part of the access token and should not be
shared publically.</dd>
<dt>User ID</dt>
<dd>This value is the encoded User ID for your user. This is normally provided as part of the
access token.</dd>
<dt>Application Name</dt>
<dd>The registered application name for this Token/Secret</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once you make any changes or additions, remember to click the <span class="button">Add/Update Profile</span> button to
save your work.</p>
<h4>Host Patterns</h4>
<p>This is a comma separated list of the root hosts where Flixo should sign requests. These are matched
using a regular expression, so be careful how you enter the host. (e.g. 'netflix.com' would match against
any *.netflix.com host.)</p>
<p>As with the Profiles section, Click <span class="button">Set</span> to save your changes.</p>
<h3>Accounts</h3>
<p>This is a list of the created Profiles. You can select the profile you wish
to make active by clicking on it. The Active profile is marked with a radio button
dot next to the name.</p>
<h3>Send Auth Info</h3>
<p>This allows you to determine what level of Auth information to send out.</p>
<h3>Expand</h3>
<p>For catalog queries that have "expandable" elements, provide the list of items to automatically expand.</p>
<h3>View</h3>
<p>Return the results as Plain ol' XML, JSON, Atom XML format or Atom</p>
<h3>Jump To</h3>
<p>Just a handy set of links to jump to. Top of API list, the User branch or the Catalog branch.</p>
<h2>Flixotize</h2>
<img src="flixo_tize.png" alt="flixotize a selected link" />
<p>If you select a link, and right click (or bring up the context menu), you'll see an option to "flixotize"
the link. (make sure you select the entire link.)</p>
<p>Flixotizing a link will ask to substitute variables in the template (if any
exist) and load it to the current window. This will autosign the URL for you.</p>

<h2>Secret Options</h2>
<p>As your reward for getting through this much of the document (and my hurried writing) let me reward you with the secret debugging values you can set in about:confg.</p>

<p>All values are of type "Boolean" unless otherwise noted:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Option</th><th>default</th><th>function</th></tr>
    <tr><td>extensions.flixo@netflix.com.debug</td><td>false</td><td>set <b>true</b> to turn on debugging. Debugging output is sent to the javascript console. This can be QUITE verbose and WILL slow down calls using Flixo.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>extensions.flixo@netflix.com.oauthInHeaders</td><td>true</td><td>set <b>true</b> to include the OAuth information in the outbound headers. Set to <b>false</b> to include the OAuth info in the URL.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>extensions.flixo@netflix.com.oauth_plaintext</td><td>false</td><td>set <b>true</b> to sign the requests using OAuth PLAINTEXT signatures. (Currently, such requests are rejected, but it's useful for debugging.)</td></tr>
</body>
